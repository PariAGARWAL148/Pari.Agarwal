In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an Internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory.<br> He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as web technology spread.<br> Sir Tim Berners-Lee changed the world: he invented the World Wide Web. He then gave the web to all of us for free â€“ a move that sparked a global wave of creativity, collaboration and innovation never seen before. The web has changed the world, but that free and open web is today under threat.
